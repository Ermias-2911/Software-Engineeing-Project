### Product Summary:
Our product GatorRent is an anaccommodation-search application is intended for the use of the students of San Francisco State University (SFSU) to find housing and for landlords that are looking for renters alike. This application is important as on-campus housing at SFSU is extremely limited and expensive thus making it difficult for both domestic students and international students to find accommodation within their budget and preference.
The GatorRent application will allow a user (users of the GatorRent application includes landlords looking for renters and students looking for housing etc.) to either post houses, apartments, rooms that they are renting out, or for the user to filter through the currently available listings posted on the application. Our application will allow users to find listings based on e.g. distance from the university, rent price. The design of this application will take into account of the technical experience/familiarity of the user by implementing a simple and straightforward design with large buttons and appropriately sized writing along with the use of images and colours to create a more visual-oriented design for ease of use and accessibility. Thus, making GatorRent uniquely tailored for students and landlords as compared to other applications currently on the market.<br />
Our student start-up team is comprised of current computer science students of SFSU, including domestic and international students of different backgrounds. Our personal experiences with finding off-campus and on-campus housing have contributed largely to the ideation of the intended purpose and design of the GatorRent application with the potential range of users in mind.

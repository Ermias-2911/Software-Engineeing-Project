## [GitHub Master](#github-master)

The following are the responsibilities of the GitHub Master:

Check GitHub as often as possible and keep issues and pull requests organized. Make sure the `master` branch does not have unusual commits.

1. All reviewers have reviewed, AND
2. All reviewers say that code/file changes are ready for merge, AND
3. The PR is not still being worked on i.e. no more changes are needed for the PR.

In other words, a PR is good to close when code submitted in the PR has no more errors and is correct in functionality/implementation. How to verify that this is true? Ask PR author and reviewers OR you can test the changes yourself.

#### When to close an issue?
1. When all TODO items have been completed, AND
2. When the issue's related PR has been merged.

#### Keep the Conversation Going
Ping the tagged team member if **they haven't responded within 24hrs** on a particular issue or pull request.

#### Label Issues and PR(s)
All issues and pull requests should have a relevant `label` and `milestone` attached.

#### Keep Commit Messages Consistent
Make sure that the commit messages are understandable and follows the format as stated on the [Commits](https://github.com/CSC-648-SFSU/csc648-sp19-team08/blob/docs-handbook-git-master-duty/docs/git-work-flow.md#commits) section.
